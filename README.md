</h1>
<p align="center">
  The third iteration of <a href="https://monablanc.github.io/" target="_blank">monablanc.github.io</a>, a portofolio made from scratch and that i intend to put my projects on. I realized this project while learning HTML and CSS, this is the first website I create. I intend to put my projects on it so I will keep it updated regulary. This project will evolve along my knowledge of frontend. That is why there are different versions.
